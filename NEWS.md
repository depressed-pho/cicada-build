# Release notes

## 1.1.0 -- not released yet

* Renamed the package from `@depressed-pho/cicada-build` to
  `cicada-build`. Since it's not meant to be published on the public NPM
  repository, it doesn't make sense to have a scope.
* Relative imports in TypeScript modules now require extensions.

## 1.0.0 -- 2023-01-01

* Initial release.
